## Description

Based on a pep talk generator that [@VVh1sp3r](https://twitter.com/VVh1sp3r) [tweeted](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJgwQhBXMAUR34M?format=jpg&name=medium).  

I thought it would be a fun little project to use as my first Go program.  

It takes 1 reandomly selected phrase from 4 columns, or 2D arrarys, and combines them to create a simple pep talk sentence. The random function checks the size of each array (column) passed to it, so the arrays don't have to be equal size if you wanted to add or remove phrases.  

## How To Run

1. copy the code  
1. `go run generator.go`
